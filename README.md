# Portfolio  site

## Development

The application uses the React javascript framework with typescript. I've also used i18n to translate the application,
to german, english and hungarian. For the look of the website I've used tailwind, following the catppuccin scheme and
using daisyUI styled components here and there.

## Deployment

The site is deployed using Google Cloud Platform in a container,
utilising a custom domain registered under the Hungarian top level domain.
The application is containerised using the npm docker base image.
