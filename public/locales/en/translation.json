In addition to software development, their deployment and infrastructure are \nalso among my areas of interest, including <indigoUnderline>DevOps, virtualization and networking tasks.</indigoUnderline> <break /> \nMy hobbies also include IoT and electronics, but I'm also keen on history and geography.\n",
